# odin-recipes
So this is my first ever programming project and it is through the Odin project.
So far ive actually learned more than i thought i could in the time spent so my expectations are decent for the level of skill i have right now.

My expectation is that i know how to write in different styles and sizes, i know how to add links, lists and images to the website to make it more lively.
