    <h3>Best food ever a.k.a Cevapi!</h3>
    <p>Ćevapi are a beloved Croatian dish, often enjoyed as a street food or at family gatherings. These small, grilled sausages, typically made from a mixture of ground beef and pork, are seasoned with onion, garlic, and spices, giving them a rich flavor.
         Served in soft, fluffy bread called somun, they are often accompanied by chopped onions and red pepper-based condiments. 
         Ćevapi embody the essence of Balkan cuisine, showcasing the region's culinary traditions and the joy of communal dining.</p>
